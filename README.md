## Introduction

Iâ€™m Brandon Yee, a Chinese American Sophomore at Weston High School. Ever since my childhood, I have had a yearning to solve problems, whether it was the allure of the Rubix Cube or the difficulty in fixing an issue on my computer I have always enjoyed spending countless hours fixing my own issues. Coding and software engineering is my medium to do so as a career; with coding, I can not only solve my own problems but also create solutions to problems bigger than myself and give back to the world. I want to pursue software engineering in college and combine this passion with my passion for finance to dual-major in computer science and finance.
